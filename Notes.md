Functionality Notes (logical flow for later perusal)
- Users can create shows, edit shows, and delete shows
    -> They should only be able to edit/delete shows that they created
    -> Doing this would require that shows track their creator
    -> Functionally, it would be worthwhile to then have other users be able to request updates/changes due to not being able to edit directly
        -> Also, would recommend that shows in shows index be listed Alphabetically and dupes flagged
